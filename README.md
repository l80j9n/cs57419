Critical Reflective Essay
Instructions
Assessment   1,   MGMT 211, S2, 2024 (30% of final course   grade)
Due date:   18th August,   11:59pm via Canvas
Reflective essay of 2500 words (excluding reference   list) and submitted   as   a   Word   document.   Please see below for the assignment   brief.
TASK:
1. Write a critical   reflective essay using content   from   three   course   topics   that   have   interested   or   intrigued you and relate that content to you   and your   own   experiences.
2.   Examine   how relevant concepts and theory on the topics   explain   and/or   contradict your   own   organisational experiences   (you can use any organisational context   e.g.,   university, work,
sports organisations, religious institutions, clubs,   school,   etc).
3. You should be showcasing your understanding of the topic   content   as well   as   your   critical   reflective thinking and   learning skills   by completing a full reflective   cycle   as   per   Gibbs'
model of   reflection.
Gibbs' reflective cycle   provides a systematic approach   in examining   experiences   to   aid   active
learning and it   has six stages (description, feelings,   evaluation,   analysis,   conclusions,   and   action
plan). You should demonstrate these stages in your critical   essay   -   not with/as   headings though.   More
details   on   Gibbs' model   is   available   here   (https://www.ed.ac.uk/reflection/reflectors-   toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/gibbs-reflective-cycle)   .
Other helpful resources include the   University of   Auckland's   Learning   Hub   (reflective thinking   and   writing) (https://www.learninghub.ac.nz/writing/reflective-writing/)   , reflective   essays   in   Business
and   Economics   (https://www.monash.edu/student-academic-success/excel-at-writing/annotated-
assessment-samples/business-and-economics/buseco-reflective-essay), and   a   straightforward   guide   to   effective   reflective   writing   (https://libguides.bham.ac.uk/c.php?g=679095p=4970304)   .
Guidelines:
·      The reflective essay   is based on the   assumption that   learning   becomes   more   meaningful when   new   information (ideas, theories/concepts, frameworks)   is explored through the   lens of   personal   perspectives and experience.
·      You are   being asked to think about your own   learning   in   relation to the   topics
(theory/concepts, frameworks) covered   in weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5   by   completing   a full   reflective   cycle. You should only select content covered   in those weeks.
·      Completing a full reflective cycle   requires that you analyse   past   organisational   experiences,   reflect on   present   learning, and discuss   influence on future actions   using   a   critical   perspective.
·      You代 写Assessment 1, MGMT 211, S2, 2024Matlab
代做程序编程语言r essay should   help you to   identify and question your own assumptions   and   behaviour   in   workplace situations and develop relevant   insights   into your potential   future   roles.
·      Becoming critically self-reflective also requires close examination   of your   interactions,   reflexes,   and understandings from   multiple   perspectives.   It   may   help, for example, to identify silent voices      in a scenario (what   is   not said) or to draw   on   differing   theoretical   perspectives   in   your   analysis.
·      You must   use academic sources   (from course   materials and your own   research   -   published,
peer reviewed journal articles) to support, challenge, or extend your own   reflections.   It   is   expected   that you   have a minimum of   10 academic   sources.
·      This, of course,   means that you   need to   have   in-text citations and a   reference   list   in the   correct   APA 7th edition format.   It will be a fatal error   if either or   both   of these   are   omitted from your
reflective   essay.   APA   style   advice   can   be   found   here   (https://www.cite.auckland.ac.nz/2_8.html)   .
·      We are looking at the quality and   depth   of your critical   reflection, your   academic   writing   and   referencing skills, as well as your own learning from the   course   through your   insights   and   application of the course content.
Formatting and submission:
·      Your assignment   must   be submitted as a WORD (doc or   docx)   file   on   the   assignment   page   on   CANVAS   by   19th August 2024,   11:59pm.
·      Your full   name and student   ID   number should   be   placed   in the   header of   each   page and   page
numbers   in the footer.   Pages can   be aligned   left or   justified, and   1.5   line spacing   should   be   used.   Note, 2500 words +/-   10%.
·      Please   use easy-to-read fonts and font sizes like   Calibri, Arial, or Times   New   Roman -   all   at   12pt   size; or Verdana (11pt   size).
.    All submissions will   be checked through   the   Turnitin.
